###Overview->

        *Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student scores dataset to uncover insights and trends.

        *Analyzed distribution of marks in various subjects, identifying trends such as concentration of marks between 60 and 80.

        *Explored relationships between demographic variables (such as parents' education level, ethnic group) and student performance.

        *Investigated the impact of study hours and test preparation on students' marks.

        *Utilized Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.



###Final Observations->

         *All the marks columns are forming a negatively skewed distribution.

         *Marks are mainly concentrated between 60 and 80.

         *The NrSiblings column is slightly positively skewed.

         *The majority of NrSiblings data is concentrated between 1 and 3.

         *Parents' education seems to have an impact on students' marks; higher degrees correlate with higher average marks.

         *Ethnic group E has higher average marks compared to other groups.

         *Males have higher average marks in math, while females have higher average marks in reading and writing.

         *As expected, students with a higher number of study hours tend to have higher average marks in each subject.

         *Students who completed TestPrep tend to have higher average marks in each subject.
